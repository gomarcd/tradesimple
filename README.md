# Tradesimple

A trade journaling app for Wealthsimple.

But why?

Because none of the prominent trade journaling platforms support Wealthsimple. Because all of the other fintech apps out there that do support Wealthsimple, only do so via third party aggregators that are unreliable at best.

Tradesimple is a modern, open-source webapp leveraging a secure, direct connection to Wealthsimple via its GraphQL API.

## Security

Due to the nature of the application, good security practice is paramount:

:white_check_mark: Application login protected by enterprise-grade secure sign on, Oauth support with Google, Microsoft, GitHub, Apple, Multi-Factor authentication, Passkeys, Magic Auth

:white_check_mark: External key vault service protects Wealthsimple connection, even in the event Tradesimple's database is breached

:white_check_mark: Session audit trail with full control over Wealthsimple connection

:white_check_mark: Optionally self-host your own instance for full control

## Technology

:white_check_mark: Laravel 12

:white_check_mark: Livewire 3

:white_check_mark: Flux 2
