# Tradesimple

A personal finance and trade journaling app for Wealthsimple.

But why?

Because none of the prominent trade journaling platforms support Wealthsimple. Because all of the other fintech apps out there that do support Wealthsimple, only do so via third party aggregators that are unreliable at best.

Tradesimple is a modern open-source webapp leveraging a direct connection to Wealthsimple via its GraphQL API intended to fill the gap for Wealthsimple users who are underserved by existing fintech apps looking to automate the tracking of their trading and personal finance. 

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Made with love in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

> [!WARNING]  
> By using this software and connecting your Wealthsimple account(s), you accept full and absolute responsibility for any and all losses and/or damages in the unlikely event anything should go wrong.
