# Tradesimple 🇨🇦 

A trade journaling app for Wealthsimple.

But why?

Because none of the prominent trade journaling platforms support Wealthsimple. Because all of the other fintech apps out there that do support Wealthsimple, only do so via third party aggregators that are unreliable at best.

Tradesimple is a modern, open-source webapp leveraging a secure, direct connection to Wealthsimple via its GraphQL API.

## Disclaimer

**Use at your own risk**: By using this software, and connecting your Wealthsimple account to it in particular, you accept full and absolute responsibility for any stress, inconvenience, monetary or other type of loss and/or damages in the unlikely event that anything should go wrong. I am not responsible for your use or misuse of the software in any way, shape or form.

## Security

Due to the nature of the application, every effort is made towards good security posture:

:white_check_mark: Application login protected by enterprise-grade secure sign on, Oauth support with Google, Microsoft, GitHub, Apple, Multi-Factor authentication, Passkeys, Magic Auth

:white_check_mark: External key vault service protects Wealthsimple connection, even in the event Tradesimple's database is breached

:white_check_mark: Session audit trail with full control over Wealthsimple connection

:white_check_mark: Optionally self-host your own instance for full control

:white_check_mark: **On the roadmap**: SOC-2, ISO-27001, GDPR certification/compliance

This is not an exhaustive list. Additional security items may also be considered in the future, such as local keychain and hardware security key support.
